# housing vs income

A very simplistic bit of Python to munge data from Zillow (https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) and FRED(https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=175&eid=266090) and map them into a single output file, suitable for visualization.

Definitely contains inaccuracies.

Most of the work is in data/zfmap/full_zf_map.csv, which was generated by hand to match the FRED and Zillow tags.

See comments of # UPDATE: for the items that you'll need to update.

See fred_fetch.py if you want to re-fetch the salary data.  The 2024 and 2025 FRED data is blank for salary, so there's an estimate of an increase in income of 2% per year for those fields.  Open to ideas on county level data that's up to date...

You'll need to download a fresh Zillow data file from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ and put it at /data/zillow/<filename> and update paths in create_output.py, the zillow_path variable.  Remember, get the COUNTY level data.
